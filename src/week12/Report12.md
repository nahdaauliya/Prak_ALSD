## 2.1. Experiment 1: Implementing Single Linked List

The solution is implemented in Student21.java dan Node21.java, SingleLinkedList.java, and Main.java, and below is screenshot of the result.

**Brief explanaton:** There are 5 Question: 
1. Because in the program, the node has been created but not added to the LinkedList. And the program immediately prints even though there is no Node in the LinkedList yet.

2. 
    - the temp in the print() method. Used as a pointer to browse each node in the linked list
    - temp in the insertAfter method. Used to find the node with the student name that is cock with the key.
    - temp in the insertAt method is used to navigate to the node at the position before the destination index.

4. It's okay if you don't use a tail. It won't matter if we only have a small amount of data. Because if we want to run the addLast method without tail, we have to browse the linked list from the head to the last node first. And if we have a lot of data, the addList method will take longer to process.


## 2.2 Experiment 2: Accessing Element in Single Linked List

The solution is implemented in Student21.java dan Node21.java, SingleLinkedList.java, and Main.java, and below is screenshot of the result.

**Brief explanaton:** There are 2 question: 
1. 'break' here functions to stop the loop if it has found the key. 
2. to remove the node after temp. Then ensure that the tail pointer still points to the last node

## 2.3 Assignment
The solution is implemented in Assignment.java, AssignmentNode.java, Assignment.java, and AssignmentSLLMain.java, and below is screenshot of the result.
